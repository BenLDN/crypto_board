# crypto_board
Simple message board that attached the actual BTC price to each message.

Uses port 5000.

createDB.py: not part of the app, it was used to create the SQLite database (messages.db)

Tested on AWS EC2.

# Plan to improve the site

Add registration option
Add another board for ETH
Add option to "bet" with virtual money
Caching instead of a new API call for each message
Make it pretty
Add admin option to: delete message or all messages
