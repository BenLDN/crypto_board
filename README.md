### Working Version

(hosted on Google Cloud Platform)
### User and message database
createDB_msg.py and createDB_usr.py are only used to create the database files that store users (users.db) and messages (messages.db). <br />
There are sample db files included in this repo but new ones can be created and used instead of those.
