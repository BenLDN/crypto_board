CryptoBoard
===========

Warning
-------
I created this a long time ago and it's **not** maintained anymore.

What is this?
-------------
Simple message board where each message is a simulated bitcoin buy or sell transaction.  

User and message database
-------------------------
createDB_msg.py and createDB_usr.py are only used to create the database files that store users (users.db) and messages (messages.db). <br />
There are sample db files included in this repo but new ones can be created and used instead of those.
